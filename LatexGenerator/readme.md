# Description
directory for generate latex template

# To-do list
- Missing values for criterion A 
    - From CAIDI (ICT Industry Liaison, Key Academic Staff)
    - From excel (Unit Coordinator, File #)
    - Justification from program design
    - CAIDI file for each of the program
- Questions for criterion C
    - We noticed that the column names for criterion C tables in the ACS template and UWA submitted document are different, should we adjust the latex generated column name with the ACS template?
- Missing values for criterion D
    - assessment item (maybe got deleted from version 0923?)

# Troubles met
